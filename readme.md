# A Cookbook of Short Solutions to Various Bioinformatics Problems

## Motivation

I'm constantly doing small, one-off analyses that require a bit of effort to do, then a year later I find myself needing to do it again. This is intended to be a cookbook so that Future Me can more easily solve these problems.

## Solutions

- Plot the cumulative number of genomes for a given species that have been uploaded to SRA over time
- Remove positions with gaps from a multifasta alignment
